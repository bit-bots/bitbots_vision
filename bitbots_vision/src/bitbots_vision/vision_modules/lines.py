    """
    Detecting field lines in the image.
    The line detection module is responsible for finding the white field markings
    that are especially important for the localisation of the robot.
    It mainly uses the ColorDetector and HorizonDetector because white lines
    should only be found on the field (and therefore under the horizon).
    At first the module creates lists of random x and y coordinates
    below the horizon and then checks wherever the resembling points are part
    of the white color mask. Afterwards a list is returned that contains
    these white points that are most likely part of a white field marking.
